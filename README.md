# Bootstrap-senior

The goal of this project is to produce a framework based off bootstrap that is designed for development of websites that are more senior user friendly. 

It consists of a default theme for an off-the-shelf framework package and a customizer based on [getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/)'s customize page except modified to only allow senior accessible parameter settings.
